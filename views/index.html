							<h2>Dismantling Stereotypes -- Positive Portrayals of Islam in Pop Culture </h2>

							<h3>What is Orientalism?</h3>
							<p>
								<i>Orientalism</i> is a term used to describe a created representation that emphasizes, exaggerates, and distorts differences of Arab peoples and cultures as compared to that of the West (specifically Europe and the U.S.) First perpetuated through academic scholarship during a time of colonialism, orientalist themes continue to be reinforced over time through various means. This basic dichotomy acts to construct the "East" as vastly different and inferior, in need of Western intervention. Painting the East as backwards, exotic, uncivilized, and at times dangerous, helps to affirm the supremacy of Europe and its ideals, particularly during a time of colonialism. This juxtaposition of the West with the Orient creates a “relationship of power, of domination, of varying degrees of hegemony.” Orientalism is embodied through various means, such as academic scholarship and common media portrayals. This kind of thinking ultimately justifies the "othering" of Arab communities, as well as Muslim communities. 
							</p>
							
							<h3>How is this relevant to pop culture?</h3>
							<p>
								These orientalist ideas continue to permeate in contemporary society, particularly in post-9/11 United States. For example, the image of the backwards, exotic, uncivilized, and even dangerous Orient, and ultimately Arab peoples and Muslims, is repeatedly shown in Hollywood. According to academic scholar Jack Shaheen, negative representations of Arabs and Muslims have existed in Hollywood for more than a century and continue to be reproduced. From movies like <i>The Sheik</i> (1921), <i>Cairo (1943)</i>, <i>Ernest In The Army</i> (1997), and <i>Rules of Engagement</i> (2000) to even Disney’s <i>Aladdin</i> (1992), Arabs are portrayed as dehumanized caricatures while the Middle East and its peoples are portrayed as foreign, barbaric, and repressive. And while these portrayals exist in Hollywood, they are not limited to its borders. One can find examples of orientalist thinking in different subgenres of pop culture, from television and mass media to music and art.
							</p>
							<h3>Going against the Orientalist mold</h3>
							<p>
								For every negative portrayal of Islam in pop culture, there are positive portrayals of Islam, Arabs, and Muslims. Our website is dedicated to showing these positive portrayals.

								<h2> Comic </h2>
								<p>Comics are just as popular as in Arab and Muslim countries as they are in West. 
								   However, we always see Western culture and values reflected in all these comics.
								   Comics such as "99" sought to bring Islamic teachings into the world of comics by 
								   creating heros based on the 99 virtues of Islam.

								<h2> Comedy </h2>
								<p>Comedy is a powerful tool that can dispel negative connotations or stereotypes. 
								   Using humor, comedians such as Meena Sameh Dimian and Maysoon Zayid show the ridiculous
								   the stereotypes people have against Islam. Through laughter these comedic geniuses combat Islamophobia.
