						<p> The 99 is a comic based on the 99 attributes of Allah. 
						Each of the 99 characters are teenagers name for one of these attribute;
						for example, Aleem -- the all-knowing, Batina -- the hidden and Samda -- the invulnerable.
						The characters hail from across the globe and unite in their pursuit of social 
						justice and peace against the forces of chaos and evil. Since the comic involves
						teenagers around the world, it allows school age children from all backgrounds to find a 
						common ground.<br></br>
						The 99 is a huge success around the world and has even been premiered as an animation series.

								Ms. Marvel, who was originally a blond military pilot who could fly, shrug off bullets, and shoot energy blasts from her hands, was recently reimagined as Kamala Khan, a Pakistani-American Muslim teenager from New Jersey. Unlike her predecessor, she is able to grow and shrink different parts of her body and will eventually gain the ability to shape-shift. Although Khan is not the first Muslim character in the Marvel universe, she is the first Muslim character to headline their own comic book series. The new Ms. Marvel made her first appearance in Captain Marvel #14 (August 2013). Writer G. Willow Wilson, artist Adrian Alphona, and editor Sana Amanat (who is notably Muslim herself) were Khanâ€™s creators.
